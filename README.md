# Cordel Library API

This project provides the backendy goodness for the associated front end UI https://github.com/vomoir/CordelLibraryUI

The backend is written as a minimal API and uses Swagger to privide a simple interface for testing (I haven't used much of Postman for testing).

The API needs to be run under https so to kick it off run this in the terminal:Â   
`dotnet run --launch-profile https`

The database is seeded at run time so there's something to look at and play with.
